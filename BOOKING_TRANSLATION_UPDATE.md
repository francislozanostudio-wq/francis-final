# Booking Page Translation Update

## Problem
Service and add-on names in the booking page were not translating to Spanish when the language was changed, even though the Services page was working correctly.

## Solution
Updated all booking form components to use the `translateByText()` function, which automatically translates text when the language is changed to Spanish.

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/components/booking/ServiceSelectionStep.tsx`
- Added `translateByText` to the translations hook
- Updated service name display: `{translateByText(service.name)}`
- Updated service description display: `{translateByText(service.description)}`
- Updated selected service summary: `{translateByText(selectedService.name)}`

### 2. `src/components/booking/AddOnSelectionStep.tsx`
- Added `useTranslations` import
- Added `translateByText` to the component
- Updated add-on name display: `{translateByText(addOn.name)}`
- Updated add-on description display: `{translateByText(addOn.description)}`
- Updated selected add-ons list: `{translateByText(addOn.name)}`

### 3. `src/components/booking/ReviewStep.tsx`
- Added `translateByText` to the translations hook
- Updated service name in review: `{translateByText(service.name)}`
- Updated add-on names in review: `{translateByText(addOn.name)}`
- Updated add-on descriptions in review: `{translateByText(addOn.description)}`

### 4. `src/components/booking/ConfirmationStep.tsx`
- Added `translateByText` to the translations hook
- Updated service name in confirmation: `{translateByText(service.name)}`
- Updated add-on names in confirmation: `{translateByText(addOn.name)}`

## How It Works

The `translateByText()` function works by:
1. Taking the English text as input
2. Looking up the Spanish translation in the database translations
3. Returning the Spanish translation if found, otherwise returning the original English text
4. This is the same approach used in the Services page, which was already working correctly

## Testing

To verify the translation is working:
1. Go to the booking page
2. Change the language to Spanish using the language selector
3. Go through the booking steps:
   - **Step 1 (Service Selection)**: Service names and descriptions should appear in Spanish
   - **Step 2 (Add-Ons)**: Add-on names and descriptions should appear in Spanish
   - **Step 5 (Review)**: All service and add-on information should be in Spanish
   - **Step 6 (Confirmation)**: Confirmation details should show Spanish service/add-on names

## Important Notes

- The actual translation data is stored in the database in the `translations` table
- Service names, descriptions, and add-on information need to have their Spanish translations added via the admin panel or database
- The function automatically handles missing translations by falling back to the English text
- This update makes the booking page consistent with the Services page translation behavior

## Next Steps

Make sure all service names, descriptions, and add-on information have Spanish translations in the database:
1. Go to Admin Panel
2. Navigate to Translations management
3. Add Spanish translations for all service names and descriptions
4. Add Spanish translations for all add-on names and descriptions

The translation system will automatically pick up these translations once they are added to the database.
