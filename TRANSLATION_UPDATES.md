# Translation System Updates

## Overview
This update fixes the translation system to ensure all text on the Hero section, Gallery page, and About page is properly translated to Spanish and connected to the admin dashboard.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Hero Section (Index Page)**
- âœ… Title: "Francis Lozano Studio" 
- âœ… Subtitle: "Exquisite nail artistry by appointment in Nashville..."
- âœ… About section: "Artistry Redefined" and description

### 2. **Gallery Page**
- âœ… Bottom CTA text: "Love what you see? Book your appointment today..."
- âœ… Custom design section: "Bring Your Vision to Life" and full description
- âœ… All buttons and call-to-action text

### 3. **About Page**
- âœ… All values/philosophy cards (Passion-Driven Artistry, etc.)
- âœ… Journey timeline (2019-2023 milestones)
- âœ… Main content paragraphs (welcome text, studio description, philosophy)
- âœ… Studio experience section
- âœ… All section titles and subtitles

## Files Modified

1. **Migration File Created:**
   - `supabase/migrations/20251005120000_add_missing_translations.sql`
   - Adds 40+ missing translation keys for Gallery and About pages

2. **Pages Updated:**
   - `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Already using translations âœ…
   - `src/pages/Gallery.tsx` - Updated to use `t()` function for all hardcoded text
   - `src/pages/About.tsx` - Updated to use `t()` function for all hardcoded text

3. **Admin Integration:**

   - Real-time updates when translations are modified
   - Connected to Supabase database

## How to Apply the Migration

6. Click "Run" to execute

### Option 3: Reset Database (if needed)

# Or push migrations
supabase db push
```

## How It Works

### Language Switching
The language selector in the navigation automatically:
1. Fetches all translations from Supabase
2. Switches between English and Spanish
3. Stores preference in localStorage
4. Updates all pages in real-time

### Translation Priority
1. **Admin-managed content** (homepage_content, about_content) takes priority
2. **Fallback to translations table** if admin content doesn't exist
3. **Fallback to default English** if translation is missing

### Real-time Updates
- Changes in admin dashboard appear immediately on the website
- No page refresh needed
- Real-time subscriptions via Supabase

## Testing

### Test Spanish Translation
1. Go to the website homepage
2. Click the language selector in navigation
3. Select **EspaÃ±ol**
4. Verify all text is translated:
   - Hero section
   - About section below hero
   - All navigation items

### Test Gallery Page
1. Navigate to Gallery page
2. Check bottom section text is in Spanish
3. Check "Bring Your Vision to Life" section is translated

### Test About Page
1. Navigate to About page  
2. All sections should be in Spanish:
   - Value cards
   - Journey timeline
   - Main content
   - Studio experience

### Test Admin Updates
1. Login to admin
2. Go to Translations
3. Edit `gallery.book_cta` Spanish text
4. Save changes
5. Visit Gallery page (Spanish mode)
6. Verify the text updated instantly

## Troubleshooting

### Translations not showing?
1. Check if migration was applied: Run the SQL in Supabase dashboard
2. Verify translations exist in database: Check `translations` table
3. Clear browser cache and reload
4. Check console for errors

### Spanish text still in English?
1. Make sure language is set to Spanish in selector
2. Check if Spanish translation exists in translations table
3. Verify `is_active = true` for the translation
4. Check browser localStorage for saved language preference

### Admin changes not appearing?
1. Check real-time subscription is working
2. Refresh the page
3. Verify changes were saved in database
4. Check for JavaScript errors in console

## Summary

All text that was previously hardcoded in English has now been:
- âœ… Added to the translations database
- âœ… Connected to the translation system using `t()` function
- âœ… Made editable through the admin dashboard
- âœ… Available in both English and Spanish
- âœ… Updates in real-time when modified

The website is now fully bilingual with complete admin control! ðŸŽ‰
