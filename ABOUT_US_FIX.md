# About Us Page Fix - Supabase Sync Issue

## Problem Identified
When editing content in the About Us admin panel, changes appeared to save but would revert to old text after approximately 5 seconds. The issue was that changes were being saved to Supabase successfully, but the admin UI was not properly reflecting those changes.

## Root Cause
The admin panel functions (`updateAboutContent`, `addNewSection`, `deleteSection`, `toggleSectionVisibility`) were successfully saving data to Supabase but were not immediately refreshing the local state after the database operation. Instead, they relied on the real-time subscription to update the UI, which had a 5-second delay.

This created a confusing user experience where:
1. User makes changes in the admin panel
2. Changes save to Supabase ✅
3. UI shows old data for ~5 seconds ❌
4. Real-time subscription eventually picks up the change
5. UI updates to show correct data

## Solution Implemented
Added `await fetchAboutContent()` calls immediately after successful database operations in all CRUD functions:

### Files Modified
- `src/pages/admin/AdminAbout.tsx`

### Functions Fixed

#### 1. `updateAboutContent()`
**Before:** After updating the database, only closed the dialog
**After:** Now calls `await fetchAboutContent()` to immediately refresh the data before closing the dialog

```tsx
await fetchAboutContent(); // Added this line
setIsEditDialogOpen(false);
setEditingSection(null);
```

#### 2. `addNewSection()`
**Before:** After inserting new section, only reset the form
**After:** Now calls `await fetchAboutContent()` before resetting the form

```tsx
await fetchAboutContent(); // Added this line
// Reset form
setNewSection({...});
```

#### 3. `deleteSection()`
**Before:** After deleting, only showed success toast
**After:** Now calls `await fetchAboutContent()` before showing the toast

```tsx
await fetchAboutContent(); // Added this line
toast({...});
```

#### 4. `toggleSectionVisibility()`
**Before:** After toggling visibility, only showed success toast
**After:** Now calls `await fetchAboutContent()` before showing the toast

```tsx
await fetchAboutContent(); // Added this line
toast({...});
```

## Testing Instructions
1. Go to `/admin/about` in the admin dashboard
2. Edit any section's content
3. Click "Save Changes"
4. Verify that the changes appear immediately in the admin list
5. Check the public About Us page to confirm changes are visible
6. Try adding a new section, deleting a section, and toggling visibility
7. All operations should now update the UI immediately without delay

## Benefits
✅ Immediate UI feedback after saving
✅ No confusing 5-second delay
✅ Better user experience
✅ Data consistency between Supabase and UI
✅ Still maintains real-time subscription for multi-user scenarios

## Related Code
The real-time subscription remains in place and continues to work correctly for cases where:
- Multiple admins are editing simultaneously
- Changes are made from different tabs/browsers
- External database updates occur

This fix ensures immediate local updates while keeping the real-time subscription as a backup sync mechanism.
