## ⚡ Quick Tips

- **Be Specific**: "Gel Manicures" is better than just "Gels"
- **Keep It Short**: Shorter names look better on mobile
- **Use Title Case**: "Nail Art" not "NAIL ART" or "nail art"
- **Think Long-term**: Choose names you'll use for a while
- **Organize Logically**: Group similar services together
