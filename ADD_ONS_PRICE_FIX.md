# Add-Ons Price Integration Fix

## Issue
The booking system was not including add-ons prices in:
1. Final total calculation displayed to client
2. Confirmation emails (client and admin)
3. Reminder emails (24h, 1h, custom)
4. PDF confirmation document

Only the base service price was being shown, even though add-ons were selected and stored in the database.

## Solution
Updated all booking-related displays to include add-ons pricing information:

### 1. Email Templates (Edge Function)
**File**: `supabase/functions/send-booking-email/index.ts`

**Changes**:
- Updated TypeScript interface to include `selected_add_ons` and `add_ons_total` fields
- **Confirmation Email**: Now shows:
  - Service price separately
  - Each selected add-on with its price
  - Add-ons subtotal
  - Grand total (service + add-ons) in bold
  - Updated payment reminder to show correct total amount
  
- **24-Hour Reminder**: Now shows:
  - Total cost including add-ons
  - List of selected add-ons
  - Correct payment amount in reminders
  
- **1-Hour Reminder**: Now shows:
  - Total cost including add-ons
  - List of selected add-ons
  
- **Custom Reminder**: Now shows:
  - Total cost including add-ons
  - List of selected add-ons
  - Correct payment amount
  
- **Admin Notification**: Now shows:
  - Service price separately
  - Each selected add-on with its price
  - Add-ons subtotal
  - Grand total for revenue tracking

### 2. PDF Generator
**File**: `src/lib/pdfGenerator.ts`

**Changes**:
- Added add-ons section in appointment details
- Shows each selected add-on with its price
- Displays add-ons subtotal
- Shows grand total (service + add-ons) in bold
- Properly formatted for professional appearance

### 3. Confirmation Step (Client-Facing)
**File**: `src/components/booking/ConfirmationStep.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Updated service details to show:
  - Service price separately
  - Add-ons total if any selected
  - Grand total in bold/accent color
- Added new section displaying all selected add-ons with individual prices
- Shows complete breakdown for client transparency

## Testing Checklist

To verify the fix works correctly:

1. **Create a booking with add-ons**:
   - ✅ Go to Booking page
   - ✅ Select a service
   - ✅ Select one or more add-ons
   - ✅ Complete booking flow
   - ✅ Click "Confirm Booking"

2. **Verify Confirmation Page**:
   - ✅ Check that "Service Details" shows service price + add-ons total + grand total
   - ✅ Check that selected add-ons are listed with individual prices
   - ✅ Verify grand total matches: service price + sum of all add-on prices

3. **Verify Client Confirmation Email**:
   - ✅ Check inbox for confirmation email
   - ✅ Verify "Appointment Details" section shows:
     - Service Price: $XX.XX
     - Add-Ons: (list of add-ons with prices)
     - Add-Ons Total: +$XX.XX
     - Total Investment: $XX.XX (in bold/highlighted)
   - ✅ Verify "Before Your Visit" payment amount matches total

4. **Verify Admin Notification Email**:
   - ✅ Check admin email inbox
   - ✅ Verify booking details show complete price breakdown
   - ✅ Verify total price includes add-ons

5. **Verify PDF Download**:
   - ✅ Download PDF from confirmation page
   - ✅ Open and verify "Appointment Details" section shows:
     - Service price
     - Add-Ons list with individual prices
     - Add-Ons Total
     - Total Cost (in bold)

6. **Verify Database Storage**:
   - ✅ Check Supabase bookings table
   - ✅ Verify `selected_add_ons` field contains add-on details
   - ✅ Verify `add_ons_total` field has correct sum

## Database Schema
No changes required - schema already supports add-ons:
```sql
-- Already exists in bookings table:
selected_add_ons JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb
add_ons_total NUMERIC DEFAULT 0
```

## Example Output

**Before Fix**:
- Total shown: $85.00 (service only)
- Actual cost with add-ons: $110.00
- Client confused at appointment

**After Fix**:
- Service Price: $85.00
- Add-Ons (2):
  - Cuticle Oil Treatment: +$5.00
  - Extended Hand Massage: +$10.00
- Add-Ons Total: +$15.00
- **Total Investment: $100.00**
- Client knows exact cost before appointment

## Files Modified

1. `supabase/functions/send-booking-email/index.ts` - Email templates
2. `src/lib/pdfGenerator.ts` - PDF generation
3. `src/components/booking/ConfirmationStep.tsx` - Confirmation page display

## Notes

- All calculations use the formula: `service_price + add_ons_total`
- Add-ons are displayed as line items for transparency
- Email templates use conditional rendering - if no add-ons selected, shows simple total
- PDF includes add-ons in a dedicated section for clarity
- All monetary values formatted to 2 decimal places
- The booking flow already correctly saves add-ons to database (no changes needed there)

## Deployment

The edge function needs to be redeployed after changes:

```bash
# Deploy the updated edge function
supabase functions deploy send-booking-email
```

Or use the deployment script if available:
```bash
./deploy-edge-function.sh send-booking-email
```

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - All add-ons prices are now correctly included in final price calculations, emails, and PDF documents.
